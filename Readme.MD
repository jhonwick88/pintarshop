## About Pintarshop

Pintarshop is a rest api used to manage store data, starting from members, categories and items in the store. In the future I will add this api to print receipts to the printer and graph the sales level every day. It is built with golang language from google which is claimed to be very fast for api data processing level. For Database use gorm.io and network with gin-gonic.

If you find any issue in this api you can freely contact me on github. thank you :)
